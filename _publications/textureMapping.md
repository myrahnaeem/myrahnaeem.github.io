Haptic interfaces allow users to feel and explore realTworld 3D objects in an intuitive way with realistic haptic feedback. In this work, we propose a novel framework for the haptic texture mapping on real world 3d object. At first, we capture the real world object using Kinect xbox and afterward we employ texture mapping technique to assign the haptic texture model and surface texture on the triangular surface object. Finally, to validate the performance of the proposed approach we perform experimental analysis on four realTworld 3d objects.
